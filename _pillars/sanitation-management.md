    The supply component of the Philippines Approach to Total Sanitation (PhATS) aims to strengthen local supply chains for sanitation and hygiene goods and services and encourage Sanitation Marketing (SanMark). Through SanMark, suppliers and service providers market their goods and services to rural households, with the aim of increasing demand, improving supply and achieving greater sales and profits.
    <br/><br/>
    Samaritan Purse (SP), in an initial step, enrolled 25 local entrepreneurs in training and coaching on topics such as latrine product fabrication, marketing, and business model development with the goal to enable the entrepreneurs to develop small sanitation businesses which could serve their neighbors with the sanitation products they so desperately need. Sanitation Marketing activities are harmonized with the Demand Creation component of the PhATS program. Before SanMark is introduced in a community, the barangay is “triggered” by the SP Hygiene Promotion team, leading them to reach Zero Open Defecation (ZOD) at, Grade 1 (G1) status (shared latrines), creating a demand for low-cost sanitation products within the community at household level.
