    Countless studies have proven that  health is essential to achieving increased educational performance. However, the prevalence of WaSH related diseases still affects many school children in the Philippines These diseases are highly preventable through basic Water, Sanitation and Hygiene interventions. In the PhATS approach, Learning Institutions (Schools and Day Care Centers) are used as entry points and avenues to improving the health status of children and adolescents while empowering them to be messengers of change for community interventions. In addition, the approach also includes capacity development for governmental counterparts of DepEd to improve enabling environment.
    <br/><br/>
    The implementation of WaSH in Schools (WinS) and Day Care Centers uses the Three Star Approach to effectively help schools to meet the minimum standard for WaSH in learning institutions.
    <br/><br/>
    The Department of Education (DepEd) School Based Management (SBM) is used as the main mode of implementation for managing and rolling out the program component. In addition, NGO partners are using schools as entry points for their intervention to ensure that children have access to soap and water for handWaSHing; safe water for drinking; gender segregated toilets; and access to functional WaSHing facilities.
    <br/><br/>
    In line with the overall PhATS strategy, local investments are promoted as well as inter-sectoral collaboration and community involvement by including WaSH in School Improvement Plans and Annual Investment Plans. This helps schools prioritize WaSH by providing a pathway for meeting national standards.
    <br/><br/>
    Apart from improving WaSH infrastructures; children are encouraged to take the lead in daily WaSH activities and hygiene promotion aiming at empowering them to become messengers of change to their peers, parents, siblings and entire communities.
