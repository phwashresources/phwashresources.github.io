description: >
   Low demand for household sanitation and hygiene is a central constraint to service improvement, with most households unaware of the true costs of inadequate sanitation and hygiene and, therefore, preferring other spending priorities. For similar reasons, not many communities give priority to collective sanitation and hygiene improvement, with few of those using improved sanitation facilities realizing that their families are affected by the inadequate sanitation of their neighbors.
   <br/><br/>
   In line with a socio-ecologic model of change, this program pillar encourages the implementation of a range of different and complementary approaches to sanitation and hygiene demand creation at community and household levels: context, behavioral and social analysis to identify the bottlenecks and drivers towards collective sanitation outcomes; participatory demand creation campaigns designed to trigger rapid behavior change, encourage positive and sustainable actions to improve household sanitation, and plan towards collective sanitation outcomes such as Zero Open Defecation (ZOD) barangays; mass media campaigns; customized behavior change communications; local campaigns involving political, religious and community leaders; organizing and mobilizing communities to create avenues for dialogue with duty bearers to achieve consensus on action plans and coordinated action to enforce and monitor progress against those plans; and collective incentives and rewards designed to encourage behavior change, sustainability and resiliency.
