   Knowledge Management is “a systematic effort to enable information and knowledge to grow, flow and create value. The discipline is about creating and managing the processes to get the right knowledge to the right people at the right time and help people to share and action on information in order to improve performance.”
   <br/><br/>
   Knowledge Management is more challenging in a dynamic emergency context, not least because many of the key stakeholders and much of the learning from the critical emergency phase depart after a few months. Therefore, it is critical that the early recovery and early development phases include explicit mechanisms and dedicated capacity for the capture, sharing and use of the lessons learned; as well as active systems to track the implementation of strategies and plans, to ensure that policies and standards evolve, and that progress and performance reports feed back into improved policy, programming and practice.
   <br/><br/>
   Key elements include the dissemination and use of baseline and KAP survey data in program design and targeting; mechanisms to encourage routine feedback and analysis of the third-party process monitoring data; and regular horizontal learning events that provide a platform for discussing, sharing and learning from the progress, performance and innovation of other WaSH partners and local stakeholders.
   <br/><br/>
   The overall aim of Knowledge Management in PhATS is to improve the quality of WaSH service delivery and influence policy to better address rural sanitation issues in the Philippines. We’ve begun building a catalog of KM pieces including best practices, technical notes, videos, manuals and more. Check it out below:
