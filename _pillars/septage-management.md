    The final phase of the PhATS approach involves the introduction of the safe management of solid and liquid wastes, including drainage and the recycling and reuse of waste; and the development and strengthening of water quality monitoring systems, allied with the promotion of water supply protection, sanitary surveys, and safe water storage and handling.
    <br/><br/>
    The strategy assumes that the majority of these interventions will be piloted in the most progressive barangays and municipalities, with a focus on barangays that have either graduated to G2 Sustainable Sanitation barangay status, or seem likely to graduate in the near future. The intention is not to promote expensive, high-technology approaches, but to develop and refine simple and appropriate technologies and systems that can be implemented, operated and maintained by resource-scarce local governments in the typhoon-affected areas.
    <br/><br/>
    As barangays improve their sanitation and hygiene services, it will become important to introduce basic water safety planning and public health monitoring systems that are designed to detect major sanitation, hygiene or water supply problems. Point of use water quality testing and response protocols will be developed and piloted in G1 and G2 barangays, accompanied by advocacy to LGUS for the allocation of appropriate budgets and resources to sustain these services.
    <br/><br/>
    Low-cost drainage, solid waste and wastewater disposal facilities will be constructed to demonstrate and promote cost-effective waste management solutions, and encourage LGUs to work towards G3 Total Sanitation Barangay status. Where septic tanks are preferred or required (due to potential contamination of vulnerable groundwater or surface water resources), faecal sludge management (FSM) systems should be introduced. These systems will need to be appropriate for the largely rural contexts in which most implementing partners will be working, focusing on technologies and approaches that can be implemented and maintained by low capacity local governments and small private providers, in recognition that few previous FSM interventions in the Philippines have been either successful or sustainable.
    <br/><br/>
    As a first step, sustainability monitoring systems will be introduced as part of the G2 graduation process, with the aim of tracking what happens to toilet pits and septic tanks as they fill up and start to cause problems â€“ whether pits are emptied or replaced; whether septic tanks are regularly desludged; whether effluent from either toilet pits or septic tanks contaminates local water bodies or open spaces; and whether any removed pit contents or septic sludge are then safely transported, treated or disposed. Improved information on the extent and nature of these sustainability problems will be an important driver for local governments and sanitation stakeholders to finance, develop and implement appropriate solutions in areas that face public health hazards associated with unsafe sanitation and waste management systems.
